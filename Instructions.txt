Title: Zombie Simulator

Description: Create a simulation that gives an output to the user to say how many rounds it took for
	the zombies to destroy a village.

Rules: 

*Start with 1 zombie
*The village contains 100 houses
*The zombies can go into any house at random
*When a zombie destroys a house they infect a human (zombie = zombie + 1)
*If a zombie enters a destroyed house, it does not infect a human
*All zombies can move 1 time per turn
*Have a clear output to the user to state, # of Houses destroyed, # of zombies, # of Rounds it took

Hint: For this program you may want to use an array or list for the houses, Proper looping, and look into how to use
	Random.randint(min, max)
